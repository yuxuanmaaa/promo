# Technology Stack & Development Guidelines

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **React Native** or **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Redux/MobX** or **Provider pattern** for state management

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Firebase** or **AWS Amplify** for user authentication and data sync
- **SQLite** for local structured data storage
- **AsyncStorage** for simple key-value pairs
- **WebSocket (Socket.io)** for real-time features
- **Redis** for server-side caching

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Jest** and **React Native Testing Library** for testing
- **Detox/Appium** for end-to-end testing
- **Flipper** for debugging and performance monitoring

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Firebase Analytics** or **Mixpanel** for user behavior tracking
- **Sentry** for error tracking and crash reporting
- **New Relic** for performance monitoring

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm start
# or
yarn start

# Run on iOS simulator
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test
# or
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run e2e:ios
npm run e2e:android
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:ios
npm run build:android

# Generate release builds
npm run release:ios
npm run release:android
```

## Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns with clear component boundaries
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling between systems
- **Offline-First**: Design for offline functionality with sync capabilities
- **Performance-First**: Optimize for 60fps animations and quick load times
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG AA standards for inclusive design

## Code Quality Standards

- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React Native best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Document complex business logic
